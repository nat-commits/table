# table

I woke up this morning to a github account I must created when I was drunk last night. The [first](https://github.com/nat-commits/first) project is a little glimpse into my drunk soul. It's not bad. Maybe I'll finish and deploy it one of these days.

But fuck this virus. I miss cards with my friends. I think I can make a table where anyone can bring whatever they want to it, animate it, even control it with code. I think we could play magic.

(I know I'm not the first dork to try this, but the coronavirus isolation has me wanting to learn peer to peer connections.)

I'm thinking a single html file, no server, no framework, no build scripts. Just two options: start a table, join a table.
